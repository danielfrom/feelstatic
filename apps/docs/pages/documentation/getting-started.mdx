# Getting Started

## Installation

Inside your NextJS project directory, run the following:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>`npm install feelstatic`</Tab>
  <Tab>`pnpm i feelstatic`</Tab>
  <Tab>`yarn add feelstatic`</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  If you are using TypeScript, Feelstatic comes with its types definitions within the package
</Callout>

## Quick Start

### Add api route

First you need to create a file called `[[...fst]].ts` in `pages/api/feelstatic`. This contains the dynamic api route handler for Feelstatic.

```ts filename="pages/api/feelstatic/[[...fst]].ts"
import { FeelstaticApi } from 'feelstatic/api';
import { join } from 'path';

export default FeelstaticApi({
  paths: {
    root: process.cwd(),
    pages: [join(process.cwd(), '/app'), join(process.cwd(), '/pages')],
    components: [join(process.cwd(), '/app'), join(process.cwd(), '/components')],
    images: join(process.cwd(), '/public/images'),
  },
});
```

All requests to `/api/feelstatic/*` (pages, components, image etc.) will automatically be handled by Feelstatic.

The reason why you need to specify and join the paths here is because when NextJS builds on Vercel, then it will only trace (output) files needed for that specific handler - in this case the Feelstatic API. So if you don't specific the paths where your json and image are located, then Feelstatic won't be able to fetch and show them.

### Add page route

Then you need to create a `page.tsx` file in `app/feelstatic/[[...fst]]`. This contains the Feelstatic application that you can access on the site.

```ts filename="app/feelstatic/[[...fst]]/page.tsx"
import { FeelstaticPage } from 'feelstatic';

export default FeelstaticPage;
```

### Set environment variables

There are 3 required environment variables that you need to set.

```
FST_GITHUB_OWNER
```

This should be set to the owner/person/organization url of the github repository (e.g. `mikkeldamm`)

```
FST_GITHUB_REPO
```

This should be set to the repository name (e.g. `feelstatic`)

```
FST_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

This is the most important one. You need to get your [github access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) and set it.

<Callout type="default">
    You should only allow the token to access the repository that you are working with, and only choose the following permissions:
    - Read access to commit statuses and metadata
    - Read and Write access to code

</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
    Remember to set the environment variables in Vercel before deploying
</Callout>

### Create your first editable page

Now you can start adding editable pages. This is done by adding a `page.json` file beside any `page.tsx` files in the `app` folder.

Here is a small simple example of a page

```json filename="app/page.json"
{
  "hero": {
    "title": "Wow, is it so simple?!"
  }
}
```

Now you can import that `page.json` file in your `page.tsx` file and use its fields.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import page from './page.json';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{page.hero.title}</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Example

I will try to make as many examples as possible under the page **examples**, but for now you can look at the [dev](https://github.com/mikkeldamm/feelstatic/tree/main/apps/dev) site in the package folder.
