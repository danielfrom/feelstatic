## Is Feelstatic optimized for search engines?

Yes üëç

Feelstatic modifies the local `.json` files and then submits those modifications to your github repository. The responsibility of ensuring proper deployment falls on your pipeline thereafter.
At present, Feelstatic is only compatible with Next.js and Vercel. This ensures that any updates pushed to your repository are properly built and deployed, resulting in the static generation of all pages and components.

As a developer, it is your responsibility to ensure that the editable `.json` files are imported and utilized in your pages and components, in order for them to be generated during the build process.

## Avoid indexing of Feelstatic admin

To prevent search engines from indexing the admin interface of `/feelstatic`, make sure to deny indexing for that route. This can be accomplished by adding a `head.tsx` file in `app/feelstatic/[[...fst]]` and utilizing the head meta from the Feelstatic package.

```ts filename="app/feelstatic/[...fst]/head.tsx"
import { FeelstaticHead } from 'feelstatic';

export default FeelstaticHead;
```

<Callout type="info">
    The `FeelstaticHead` export only serves to set the `<title>` and `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />`.
</Callout>
