## Is Feelstatic optimized for search engines?

Yes üëç

Feelstatic works by editing the local `.json` files and pushing those changes to your github repository. From there its up to your pipeline to make sure it's being deployed.
Currently Feelstatic only works with NextJS and Vercel which ensures that any push that Feelstatic makes to you repository is being built & deployed and all pages/component are then statically generated.

Therefor it's up to you as a developer to make sure the editable `.json` files are imported and used in your pages and components so they can be generated on build.

## Avoid indexing of Feelstatic admin

To avoid the admin interface of `/feelstatic` being indexed by search engines, you should ensure that route is denying indexing. It can easily be done by adding a `head.tsx` file in `app/feelstatic/[...fst]` where you can use head meta from the Feelstatic package.

```ts filename="app/feelstatic/[...fst]/head.tsx"
import { FeelstaticHead } from 'feelstatic';

export default FeelstaticHead;
```

<Callout type="info">
    The `FeelstaticHead` export does nothing else than setting a `<title>` and `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />`
</Callout>
