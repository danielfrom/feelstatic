# Basic

Since Feelstatic works by changing local `.json` files and pushing them to your repo, I highly recommend that you add authentication to Feelstatic.

## Basic authentication

A simple way to add authentication to Feelstatic, is to use the built-in Basic authentication feature. This will secure the `/feelstatic` and `/api/feelstatic` routes via middleware. To implement this, create a `middleware.ts` file in the root of your Next.js project and add the following code:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
export { default } from 'feelstatic/middleware';

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/feelstatic(.*)', '/api/feelstatic/((?!/auth).*)'],
};
```

The route `/api/feelstatic/auth` is excluded because it is the route that instructs the browser to enforce basic authentication.

## Username and Password

Basic authentication requires an username and password. Set the following environment variables in your project:

```bash
FST_USERNAME
FST_PASSWORD
```

<Callout type="default">Remember to add these in your project environment variables on Vercel</Callout>
