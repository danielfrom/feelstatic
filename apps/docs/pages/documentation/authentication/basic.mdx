# Basic

Since Feelstatic works by changing local `.json` files and pushing them to your repo, I highly recommend that you add authentication above Feelstatic.

## Basic authentication

The most simple way to add a layer of authentication to Feelstatic is to use the built in `Basic authentication`. It works by securing your `/feelstatic` & `/api/feelstatic` routes from the middleware.
You can add it by creating a `middleware.ts` files in the root of your NextJS project with the following content:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
export { default } from 'feelstatic/middleware';

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/feelstatic(.*)', '/api/feelstatic/((?!/auth).*)'],
};
```

The reason why the route `/api/feelstatic/auth` is excluded, is because thats the route that tells the browser to force basic authentication.

## Username and Password

Basic authentication requires an username and a password. This is the environment variables you need to set:

```bash
FST_USERNAME
FST_PASSWORD
```
