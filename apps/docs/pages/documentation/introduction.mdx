# Introduction

Feelstatic is a static content management system (CMS) for websites using Next.js. 
It is designed to be simple and easy to learn, using JSON files as its foundation. Feelstatic enables developers to easily manage and organize data, while also providing end-users with a user-friendly interface to access, create, edit or delete the data as they please.

To get started, you'll need:

- a GitHub account
- a Vercel account

You can get started by visiting the [Getting Started](/documentation/getting-started) section. You can dive deeper into how Feelstatic works below, as I'll go in more details there.
